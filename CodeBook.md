Data transformations
====================

All necessary data transformations are performed within the run_analysis.R script.
No additional actions are required to process the original data set.

Variables
=========

`subject`: Refers to the ID of the subject that participated in the test
`activity`: Refers to the activity that the subject was performing while testing the equipment
`rest of the variables`: 
They are a subset of the variables contained in the original data set.
The subset contains variables that were produced using the mean() and std() functions, out of total 17 different functions.
Basic information of all variables can be found in the `features_info.txt` file contained in the original data set.
